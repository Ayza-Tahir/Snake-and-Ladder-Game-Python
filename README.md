# Snake-and-Ladder-Game-Python List
In this Python Snake and Ladder game, three lists are utilized: one for player names, one for their scores, and the third to store the names of the winners. The game simulates the classic board game where players take turns to roll a dice using the random rand function.

Players' names and initial scores are inputted, and the game proceeds with each player taking their turn. The random roll of the dice determines the number of steps a player can move on the board. As they advance, they may encounter snakes that move them downwards or ladders that elevate them.

The game continues until one player reaches the final position, emerging as the winner. The winner's name is stored in the third list. The game offers an exciting and dynamic experience, driven by randomness in dice rolls.

By using lists, the program efficiently manages player data and winner records. The Snake and Ladder game exemplifies the essence of luck and strategy, providing an engaging gaming experience while fostering competition among players.
